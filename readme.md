Odin Project: Google Homepage

This is a recreation of the google homepage to practice, solidify, and test my html and css skills.

I come from the world of it support, networking, and backend development so creating a front end is way out of my confort zone.
I learned a lot and have a deeper respect for frontend devs, designers, and the people who make wix and webflow.

This project taught me how to use chrome and firefox's dev tools to inspect html and css more closely.
Helped me understand html tags like div, image, svg, and lists.
Helped me understand the difference between inline and block elements.
Made me realize how tricky it can be to get things to look good on devices of different screen sizes.

Methodology:
I opened up google and tried to break the home page into parts.

In my view there were three main parts with a few subgroups: 
1. The Header
    a. The top left about and store area.
    b. The google apps and profile area
2. The Search Area
    a. The logo 
    b. The search bar
    c. The search buttons
3. The Footer
    a. The bottom left business information
    b. The carbon nuetral section
    c. The settings section.


With this in mind I broke down the page into these sections in my html and began styling each main area one at a time.

Things I struggled with:
positioning, verticle spacing, adjusting horizontal spacee, responsive design

Things that still need to be done:
add media queries,
make the layout adjust to smaller screen sizes (header, search container, and footer),
make the whole search bar clickable,
Logo resizing


Things that need refacotring:
lots of magic numbers in the css,
organize the css, 
if possible move from ids to classes in the html
